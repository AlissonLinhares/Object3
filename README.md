### Sobre

<p style="text-indent: 2em;" align="justify">
Oxygen is an oriented object isometric HTML5 game engine created by me and my brother, just for fun, in our free time. This engine is very portable and relatively fast, for a Javascript application.
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;" align="justify">
The main advantage of this project is the portability. This engine is able to run in almost all current browsers and input devices. Moreover, all the math behind this engine was specialized to strategy and old RPG action games.
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;" align="justify">
The current version is actually the second engine generation. The first one used a WEBGL canvas to render images, instead of canvas2D. We have decided to recreate the entire renderization mechanism because of the compatibility. The WEBGL canvas still experimental and can't run on all devices. Someday, we intend to give WEBGL another chance and came back to the old renderization algorithm, but for now the canvas2D is simple, portable and good enough for what we want to do.
